			<p><b><i>Where She's From</i></b> is a small, simple hack-and-slash game exclusively for Arduboy.</p>
			<p>A strangely quiet yet ruthless outlaw has shown up on the frontier.<br>Though there have been others like her before, none have been as efficient.</p>

			<h1>How to Play</h1>
			<p><u><b>CONTROLS</b></u><br><b>Left & Right:</b> Run<br><b>A:</b> Solar Dodge<br><b>B:</b> Solar Slash<br><b>Up + B:</b> Breaker Slash<br><b>Down + B:</b> Cleaving Slash</p>
			<br>
			<p><u><b>GOAL</b></u><br>She simply has to slay every enemy on the field.</p>
			<p><u><b>TIME</b></u><br>She has seven minutes to complete each mission.<br>If the time reaches 7:00 PM, she will die.<br>Taking damage will immediately advance time, so be careful.</p>
			<p><u><b>SOLAR DODGE</b></u><br>While using her Solar Dodge, she will be impervious to enemy attacks.<br>However, constantly using her Solar Dodge will exhaust her, and leave her open.<br>If she times her Solar Dodge right before an enemy attack, she will go into Quickdraw for 3 seconds.<br>Quickdraw will allow her to move at light speed and rapidly attack enemies without caution.</p>
			<p><u><b>SOLAR SLASH</b></u><br>Her most basic attack may do the least damage and have no special properties, but it is her quickest attack.<br>She can use this to deal more damage against a vulnerable enemy.</p>
			<p><u><b>BREAKER SLASH</b></u><br>Though this attack is fairly week, it is a great supporting tool.<br>If she uses Breaker Slash on an enemy who is blocking, she will temporarily break their guard.<br>She can also use Breaker Slash against dynamite sticks to reflect them.</p>
			<p><u><b>CLEAVING SLASH</b></u><br>This attack may appear strong, but it is slower than her other attacks.<br>If she uses this against an enemy who is preparing an attack, she will Clash with them.<br>While clashing, rotating the D-Pad clockwise will allow her to overpower her enemy and deliver a heavy blow to them.<br>However, she will be unable to Clash for 5 seconds afterwards (indicated by a pocket watch icon in the top right of the screen).</p>
